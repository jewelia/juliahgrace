        <p><strong>Why didn't someone tell me this stuff years ago?</strong></p>
        <p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3690/10029578915_628fcca265.jpg"></p>
        <p>At the time of this writing, I’ve been in Silicon Valley for 7.5 years. I’ve worked at big companies and tiny startups, and interviewed at many of the usualm (larger) suspects (Facebook, Google, etc.) as well as many startups (some now defunct, some on the road to IPO). I’m currently the Head of Engineering at <a href="https://www.tindie.com/" target="_blank">Tindie</a>.</p>
        <p>This is based on my personal experiences as well as the experiences of my close peers, mentees and other startup entrepreneurs I’ve been in close contact with. As usual, YMMV (your miles may vary).</p>
        <p><strong>All the stories are true, but (some) of the names have been changed.</strong></p>

          <h2 name="where-do-you-want-to-work" class="sub-heading">Where do you want to work?</h2>
          <p><strong>Mistake:</strong>"So who is hiring?"</p>
          <p><i>Early in my career I conducted very reactive job searches, rather than proactive. I would let the jobs/recruiters come to me rather than always keeping my eyes open for new opportunities. This often resulted in me interviewing at places I wasn’t interested in working or didn’t understand me or my career goals.</i></p>
          <p><i>While interviewing at jobs you aren’t interested in can be good interview practice, it isn’t a good long term strategy for finding a job.</i></p>
          <p><i><strong>I got into a practice of asking peers that I particularly respected where they would work if they were going to leave their job tomorrow. This yielded many great companies that weren’t on my radar yet because they were too small.</strong></i></p>
          <p><strong>Correction:</strong> Instead think about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What industries am I passionate about?</li>
            <li>What apps do I use on my phone everyday? </li>
            <li>What websites/tools do I regularly visit? (browser history is your friend)</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="row-fluid marketing">
          <h2 id="establish-priorities" class="sub-heading">Priorities, Priorities, Priorities</h2>
          <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> “I would consider any job!” </p>
          <p><i>My first startup job required me to commute 3 hours total each day and had almost no flexibility in terms of working from home. As someone who is a semi-competitive runner, this was a disaster. I was working long days (10+ hours) so I would spend 13 hours away from home each day. I never had time to run, and if I did fit in a run before work I was exhausted. I’m much more productive after I run, and I often think through tough problems while I’m running. So my quality of life suffered tremendously and I was a much less productive employee.</i></p>
          <p><strong>Correction:</strong> What are your non-negotiables?</p>
          <p>Write down a list of what is important to you for your next job; consider factors such as: location, big/small company, minimum salary requirements, flexibility to work from home, etc.</p>
          <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong>You may not know if you want to work at a startup or big company or you may not care where the job is physically located -- that is fine. Just write down what is important to you.</p>
          <p><strong>If you don’t do this, you’ll find yourself compromising on things you never thought you would (e.g. “Maybe commuting 3 hours a day won’t be that bad...”).</strong></p>

        <h2 id="resumes" class="sub-heading">Resumes (aka experience is generally replaceable)</h2>
        <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> “I have done a lot of front-end work, but I’m interested in full stack...but maybe I should apply to front-end jobs and tailor my resume to that.”</p> 
        <p><i>In the Spring of 2011 I had breakfast with <a href='https://twitter.com/dpatil'>DJ Patil</a>. I was looking at various startups and trying to figure out how to best tailor my resume for each role. The problem is that I love doing front-end work, back-end work, databases, product, etc. </p>
            <p>He gave me a great piece of advice: “Instead of pigeon holing yourself, instead tell them what you’re great at, what you’re passionate about. Then see if there is a fit."</i></p>
        <p><strong>Don’t mold your interests to fit their job requirements.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Correction:</strong> Don’t put yourself prematurely in a box.</p>
        <p>Great companies (the ones you want to work for) won’t pass on an excellent candidate because s/he doesn’t have exactly the specific skill set they are looking for (e.g. companies that say “she has written python, but we are a ruby shop, so we can’t hire her” don’t understand that great engineers not only can pick up new technologies quickly, but these passionate engineers love learning new things).<p>
        <p>There are times when deep knowledge about a particular language/infrastructure are needed, but for most roles (especially junior positions), hiring a software engineering generalist is just fine. </p>
        <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong>Experience is (generally) replaceable, passion and enthusiasm is not; show that you are excited about engineering.</p>
        <p><strong>Further Reading:</strong> Nicholas Zakas has a great blog post <a href='http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2014/07/15/generalists-and-specialists-thoughts-on-hiring/'>Generalists and specialists: thoughts on hiring</a> that I have found useful to understand at what stage hiring a specialist vs generalist is useful.</p>

        <h2 id="understanding-how-companies-hire" class="sub-heading">Understanding how companies source and hire talent (aka risk mitigation)</h2>
        <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> “I’ll just send my resume to their jobs@company.com email address”</p> 
        <p><i>I have a close friend who has a CS degree from MIT. She’s worked at several reputable large companies (but not Google, Facebook, etc.).</i></p>
        <p><i>She decided to apply for jobs at several "hot" San Francisco startups (I define "hot" as companies that have significant inbound interest to their job postings). She emailed her resume to their jobs email address.</i></p> 
        <p><i> She was turned down for every job without even 1 interview. Later she had a friend at one of these companies deliver her resume to the hiring manager; she had lunch with him and she was fast tracked through the hiring process. </i></p>
        <p><strong>Good:</strong> Companies get hundreds, if not thousands of resumes sent to their job email address each day. That is a lot of noise, and they often miss good candidates.</p>
        <p><strong>It is important to understand that most big companies have optimized their hiring process to ensure they do NOT hire less competent people. This is counter-intuitive as most people think the process is optimized to hire great people.</strong></p>
        <p>The implication of this is that they are less willing to take a chance on someone. Venture Capitalists work the same way — they would rather pass on a deal that later was a home run than do a deal that ends up a disaster. The repercussions of dealing with a bad hire (or a bad deal) are much worse that the repercussions of passing on someone or something great. It’s all about risk mitigation.  </i></p>
        <p>Here are some ways to get into a company:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have your resume given to the company through an intro - find someone in your network who knows someone at the company.</li>
                <li>If you can’t do this, find someone at the company (search their About pages, which often have links to employees’ LinkedIn, Twitter accounts, etc.) and email that person asking about the company. I’m not saying you should harass them -- just politely reach out, indicate you’re interested in the company, ask for advice on how to apply. Most people want to help.</li>
                <li>If there are any women working there and you are a woman, specifically email them. If you are not a woman, don't do this.</li>
                <li>Startups often sponsor hackathons, meetups, etc. - stalk the companies (not people) you’re interested in and go to those events. Talk face to face with employees and get their email address. Follow up with your resume and why you want to work there.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 id="linkedin" class="sub-heading">LinkedIn</h2>
        <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> "Do people actually use LinkedIn? I don’t think so, the last time I updated my profile was 2 years ago and no one looks at it."</p>
        <p><i>I have not created a resume outside of LinkedIn in 4+ years. In the very, very few times I have been asked for a PDF resume, I print my LinkedIn profile as a PDF (seriously). When done right, LinkedIn will make your life much easier.</i></p>
        <p><strong>Correction:</strong> People use LinkedIn all the time. Really, all the time -- and I'm not just talked about recruiters, although they use it a lot. If you disagree, see the section below called “Recruiter traps” and read <a href='http://www.ewherry.com/2012/06/the-recruiter-honeypot/'> Elaine Wherry's "The Recruiter Honeypot"</a>.</p>
        <p>LinkedIn is also used by anyone who might be interviewing you at a company -- they are more likely to read your LinkedIn than your resume; <strong>what would you rather do: click a link or open a PDF/Word/text document</strong>? Keep it up to date and point people to it -- it is much easier to maintain than a PDF/Word/text resume, easily findable and you don’t even have to host it on your own website!
        <p>This is why I think LinkedIn is really useful; I know a lot of people, more than I can possibly keep track of. When I'm helping my mentees I point them at my LinkedIn profile and have them look through my contacts and then ask for any intros accordingly (another trick I learned from DJ Patil).</p>
        <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> You want to be easily findable for new job opportunities; this is especially true early in your career when no one knows who you are or that you even exist.</p>

        <p><strong>Mistake:</strong>“Oh look, this recruiter at company XYZ emailed me and says I look amazing. How awesome! This recruiter really likes me and has my best interests at heart!” </p> 
        <p><i> This person didn’t even spell my name correctly:</i></p>
        <p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/12734820474_8e7fa5000d.jpg"></p>
        <p><strong>Correction:</strong> Outside/contract recruiters and recruiting firms are typically paid 20% of salary (so if you’re hired for $100K, recruiter gets $20K). They want to get as many candidates in front of a company to increase their chances of one getting hired, and thus getting paid. Don’t fall for recruiter flattery. I’m not saying recruiters are ill-willed or malicious, they will just say anything (truthful or not) to get you to respond to them.</p>
        <p>I know of many engineers who assume that to start their job search they should find a great recruiter to help them; I would instead suggest <a href='https://angel.co/jobs'>Angel List Jobs</a> or <a href='https://hired.com/'>HIRED</a>.
        <p><strong>Further Reading:</strong> <a href='http://www.ewherry.com/2012/06/the-recruiter-honeypot/'> Elaine Wherry's "The Recruiter Honeypot"</a> gives a great description of how recruiters work.</p>

          <h2 id="interview-prep" class="sub-heading">Interview Prep</h2>
        <p><strong>Mistake:</strong>“Every interview is so different that how could I prepare?”</p>
        <p><i>Several years ago I interviewed at a very "hot" SF startup that was frequently in the news. I read all the articles about the company, including a couple in-depth pieces in WIRED magazine. I went through the CrunchBase profile of the founder. I read their blog about the engineering challenges the company faced, and how they were approaching them.</i></p>
        <p><i>In the interview they asked me how I would solve these exact challenges that I had read about. I was very glad I knew what they were beforehand and had spent some time thinking about how I would do it — it almost felt like cheating.</i></p>
        <p><i>I asked them why they asked those questions, and they said that almost every person they had interviewed hadn’t read their press or their blog.</i></p>
        <p><strong>Correction:</strong> (Most) tech interviews - especially those that have generic whiteboard coding questions - are like taking the SAT. If you study, you’ll do better.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First read about the company. Understand what they do and what their challenges are.</li>
            <li>Go through <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Landing/dp/1118261364/ref=dp_ob_title_bk'>Programming Interviews Exposed</a> and do all the questions. This is an excellent reference and walks through common questions with in-depth solutions.</li>
            <li>If you need more, then tackle <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Fourth-Programming/dp/145157827X/'>Cracking the Coding Interview</a> - this is more of a rapid fire book with tons of questions and short answers, hence why I think you should go through the more detailed book first.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Programming interviews very frequently use questions from these books (sometimes with a slight change) so it helps to gain familiarity with these questions.</p>
        <p><strong>Further Reading:</strong> Lynn Root (software engineer at Spotify) has a great blog post <a href='http://www.roguelynn.com/words/sadistic-pleasure-technical-interviews/'>about how she prepared for her tech interviews</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> A friend once told me: “Whenever someone asked a question I didn’t know, I would ask the interviewer what the solution was. Nine times out of ten, at my next interview, someone would ask the exact same question."</p>

      <div class="row-fluid marketing">
         <h2 id="interviews" class="sub-heading">Interviews</h2>
        <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> "I’ll just show up and they will ask me a bunch of questions."
        <p><strong>Correction:</strong> Always, always have a list of questions to ask.
        <p>For the interview, the company will need to gauge your skill level of what you explicitly state you are good at. So even though you might not write JavaScript everyday, the company will get their best JavaScript engineer to interview you if you say your best language is JavaScript.</p>
        <p>I suggest asking these questions (in addition to your own):
        <ul>
            <li>What are your expectations for a person in this role? </li>
            <li>What does success look like?  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are interviewed by 8 different people and receive 8 different answers, RUN FAR FAR AWAY. This is because this company is not on the same page internally about what they are hiring for. You will never be successful at a company where your manager want you to do ABC, the CEO wants you to do XYZ and VP of Engineering wants you to do 123.</p>
        <p>I have found that women are frequently too humble and volunteer discussion of their weaknesses (this also applies to men but I have seen it more often happen with women). Honesty is important, but remember, you’re being compared to men who might overstate their strengths and understate their weaknesses.</p>
        <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Don’t go into a job interview saying what you can’t do/have limited experience doing -- say what you have done, what you love, what interests you and what you’d like to explore more.</p>

      <div class="row-fluid marketing">
         <h2 id="interviews" class="sub-heading">Salaries</h2>
         <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> "The company wants to give me an offer, but before they do so they have asked for my salary history. I better give them this or else they won’t offer me a job..."</p>
         <p><i>In the Spring of 2011 many of my colleagues from IBM Research were leaving for other large tech companies in the Valley. </i></p>
         <p><i>One was about to receive an offer from a very large public tech company in Mountain View, CA, but first he had to submit 5 years of salary and bonus information. He obliged and got what he thought was a competitive offer, but it was the only place he interviewed so he wasn't actually sure of this.</i></p>
         <p><i>A year later another colleague was thinking of joining that same tech company. She refused to give salary numbers, even after being repeated asked for this information from the recruiter. She instead got a competing job offer from another large tech company and used that offer (which was much higher than her current compensation) as leverage in the negotiation. Her offer for a role similiar to his was 30% higher.</i></p>
        <p><strong>Correction:</strong> It is very much to your advantage NOT to give out previous salary information.</p>
        <p>Companies want previous salary information for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What other companies are paying their people (collecting data points for competitive analysis).</li>
            <li>Seeing how low of an offer they can get away with giving you.</li>
            <li>The goal of most startup CEOs is to get the most highly qualified person for the cheapest they possibly can (ideally “under market rate”, meaning for less that what they would make at other companies).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since women are typically underpaid (because generally speaking they don’t aggressively negotiate their starting salaries as often as men), a sure fire way to continue to be underpaid in the future is to disclose your current/previous salary. This is also true in general for people who are not aggressive negotiators.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind: hiring managers will put you under a lot of pressure to give numbers. If they do, respond that the company should have plenty of information about what your market rate/worth is, thus they should give you a competitive offer.</p>
        <p>The only exception to this is if you make substaintially more than market rate, but most people do not start off like this.</p>

      <div class="row-fluid marketing">
         <h2 id="interviews" class="sub-heading">Offer Negotiation</h2>
         <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> "Wow, the company has given me an offer. It’s more than I expected! I should just accept right now." (this is an actual quote from someone I mentored)</p>
         <p><strong>Correction:</strong> Companies expect you to negotiate (even for junior dev positions). They usually build in 20% wiggle room, so if you are offered $50K they will probably would easily be open to negotiating up to $60K (and probably more), but this varies greatly by role. I have seen senior execs negotiate for 50% more.</p>
         <p>No one will get offended by you trying to get more money. I have regularly seen male applicants ask for 40% more and end up with 20% more, and women applicants ask for 20% more and end up with 10%. If the company does get offended, then it’s likely not a good fit for you anyway.</p>
         <p>The only exception to this that I have seen is new grad positions, meaning people who have just graduated from college/university. Those salaries are at times the same across the board at a company, but you can negotiate for things like relocation.</a>
        <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Negotiation is an important life skill, and people who do it come across as more senior and competent.</p>

      <div class="row-fluid marketing">
          <h2 id="interviews" class="sub-heading"> Which job should I choose?</h2>
         <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> "I have this great offer, I’ve negotiated up, so I should just take it!"
         <p><strong>Correction:</strong> Now that you have the money you want, will you be a cultural fit in the organization? (In an ideal world you shouldn’t waste your time negotiating with a company that is obviously not a good cultural fit for you, but on the other hand it can be good practice.)</p>
         <p>Look at the managers/leaders of the company (CEO if it’s a startup, department head if it’s a larger company). The qualities that s/he has are the qualities that will be valued in the company (if they are aggressive, aggressive people will more often be promoted). This is because of an intrinsic bias toward homophily - in other words, we like people more who are similar to us and often promote people who remind us of our “younger selves”.</p>
         <p>At startups, the background of the CEO generally dictates how decisions are made. Is s/he an engineer? Then most likely engineering will be more valued and have more of a say in decisions than other functions (e.g. marketing, sales, biz dev, etc.). This is because the CEO knows how these functions work and has innate biased towards them; they are her/his “favorite children”. I am not saying you should not take an engineering job at a company whose CEO used to be in, for example, sales - however, if you do want to do this, ensure the technical leaders are very strong and the CEO respects them.</p>
         <p>There is a downside to working at a company run by a former engineer: s/he will often be tempted to “help out” engineering since s/he feels most comfortable with that department because that is where s/he started. This can be very dangerous because the CEO is likely very distracted with other very important tasks (like running the company) and so s/he might be very tempted to give “drive-by advice” (meaning surface layer advice that well intentioned but not practical because it doesn’t come from a deep understanding of the details of the problem). However, because the advice came from the CEO it is often taken very seriously (often too seriously) and can be very distracting. The upside is you may have a lot of interaction with the CEO, the downside is you may have a lot of interaction with the CEO.</p>

          <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> "The startup gave me an offer, but they are also giving me equity. I don’t know what this equity means! I guess it’s a reasonable amount and I should just accept!"
          <p><strong>Correction:</strong> It is YOUR responsibility to understand stock, options, vesting, etc. My good friend David Weekly has written a great guide that is targeted towards people that have no idea how this works: <a href='http://www.scribd.com/doc/55945011/An-Introduction-to-Stock-Options-for-the-Tech-Entrepreneur-or-Startup-Employee'>An Introduction to Stock Options for the Tech Entrepreneur or Startup Employee</a>. Read the whole thing. Understand how much money the startup has raised, what the startup “runway” is (time until the company runs out of money). You don’t want to work at a company that only has 1 month of cash left in the bank (unless that is your strategy and you are very sure they will raise more money soon).
          <p>If you have never had a job offer that included equity before, then determining out how much the equity is worth can be very confusing. Do not be intimidated. Remember -- the value of your equity when you join the company might be very, very different from when you leave the company. It could be worth much more, or much less, but at the end of the day, 10% (or any %) of $0 is $0 so just because the equity are worth something now doesn’t mean they always will be.</p>
